## Default Master Password

For demonstration purposes, a sample `master.dat` file is included in this repository.

**Default Master Password:** `Xyz@4321`

> If you delete `Data/master.dat`, the program will prompt you to create a new Master Password on the next run.

## Sample Data

This repository includes sample password records in `Data/vault.dat` for demonstration purposes.

You may delete `vault.dat` to start with an empty password vault.
